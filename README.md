[Predict baby Birth Weight](https://github.com/senthildsc/PredictBaby-Birth-Weight.git)

Problems with this practice have recently been brought to light. We 
explore whether data available at birth can be used to predict 
estimated fetal weight using linear and quantile regression, random 
forests, Bayesian additive regression trees, and generalized boosted
models.
The domain of childbirth and factors influencing childbirth and the
weight of a newborn is very vast. Through past studies, it has been 
observed that the factors which affect the childbirth range from 
biological characteristics like the baby's sex, race, age of mother 
and father, weight gained by the mother during pregnancy to 
behavioral characteristics like smoking and drinking habits of the 
mother, the education and living conditions of the parents.

[Hotel Recommendation](https://github.com/senthildsc/Hotel-Recommendation.git)

All online travel agencies are scrambling to meet the Artificial Intelligence driven personalization standard set by its competitors.
In addition, the world of online travel has become a highly competitive space where brands try to capture our attention (and wallet) with recommending,
comparing, matching, and sharing. For this assignment, we aim to create the optimal hotel recommendations for Expedia’s users that are searching for a hotel to book.
Predict which “hotel cluster” the user is likely to book, given his (or her) search details.

[Customer Behavior](https://github.com/senthildsc/Customer-Behavior.git)

This article discusses our analysis of customer behavior data provided for an E-commerce site. 
We begin by discussing our motivations for this project. We will then discuss the data set and its features. Then our initial data exploration and feature engineering.
Finally we will describe the models we used to predict if a site visitor will make a purchase or will not, the results of such models, and the insights we gathered from them.

[Predict Bank Failure](https://github.com/senthildsc/predict-bank-failure.git)

The most common cause of bank failure occurs when the value of the bank's assets falls to below the market value of the bank's liabilities, which are the bank's obligations to creditors and depositors.This might happen because the bank loses too much on its investments. Although today's challenges are great, the four underlying reasons for bank failures have not changed from those of years' past, which are: An imbalance of risk versus return Failure to diversify, Offering products and services that management doesn't fully understand, and Poor management of risks.
